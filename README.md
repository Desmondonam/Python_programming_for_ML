Build a Portfolio of Projects: Undertake hands-on projects that demonstrate your skills and showcase your expertise in machine learning data engineering.

Project ideas:

Develop a data pipeline for processing and cleaning a real-world dataset.
Implement a machine learning model deployment system using containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).
Build a real-time data streaming pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes data in real-time.
Create a recommendation system using collaborative filtering or content-based approaches.
